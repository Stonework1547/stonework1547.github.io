# "Grunts"

Beasts of burden sloppily loaded  
with personal belongings and tools  
of modern mayhem, walk, head down,  
bodies scarred and eroded  
by overwork, lack of sleep and  
exposure to nature's cruel edges.  
Banded together by cramps,  
cuts, sores, sweat, and the ever-present threat  
of death so pervasive that it  
can only be coped with by deriding it.  
No shining armor a flak vest.  
No bright colors or plumes, but leaf patterns.  
No rest, no wine, no end  
to gripping the ground and  
waiting for the round.  

April 1969  
MajGen Richard C. Schulze USMC  
who commanded 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines, in Vietnam in 1969
